   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 3.0.0:

     • Drag&Drop a field to a column header to create a column for that
       field, or to the display filter input to create a display filter.
       If a display filter is applied, the new filter can be added using
       the same rules as "Apply Filter"

     • Drag&Drop a column entry to the display filter to create a filter
       for it

     • Import profiles from a .zip archive or an existing directory

     • Dark mode support on macOS and dark theme support on other
       platforms has been improved.

     • Brotli decompression support in HTTP/HTTP2 (requires the brotli
       library).

     • The build system now checks for a SpeexDSP system library
       installation. The bundled Speex resampler code is still provided
       as a fallback.

     • WireGuard decryption can now be enabled through keys embedded in
       a pcapng in addition to the existing key log preference (Bug
       15571[1]).

     • A new tap for extracting credentials from the capture file has
       been added. It can be accessed through the "-z credentials"
       option in tshark or from the "tools" menu in Wireshark.

     • Editcap can now split files on floating point intervals.

     • Windows .msi packages are now signed using SHA-2[2]. .exe
